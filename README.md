# Conversion of a plant exon sequence .txt file to a .fasta file

The input .txt file is not suitable for performing sequence analysis as it is mostly unacceptable format of input data in genomics.
A simple python script `plant_exon.py` takes the .txt exon file, and writes it to a .fasta format file

- Python version: 3.8.2

### INSTRUCTIONS

- Install pandas: `pip install pandas` or `pip3 install pandas` 
- Run: `python plant_exon.py`
- NOTE: `1601456737847_Plants_Release42_triticum_dicoccoides.txt` should remain in the same folder

- The output .fasta file has been provided `exons_seq.fasta`
